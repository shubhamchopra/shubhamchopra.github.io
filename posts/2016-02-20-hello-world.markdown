title: Hello World! Setting up a blog with Hakyll + Travis CI
---

I have recently started learning Haskell and thought it would be a good idea to log my progress. What better and more creative way than saying "Hello World!". So there goes.

Now that we have introductions out of the way, lets get to business. In this edition, I will be setting up my blog using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org). I will be using [Stack](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) and [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) 7.10. The websites have the installation process fairly well documented, so I will leave that as an exercise for the reader. This is the OS I am currently running:

```bash
$uname -or
4.3.4-200.fc22.x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Since the blog was supposed to be around Haskell in general, Hakyll seemed like the natural choice to start the blog in. After reading a few blogs around Hakyll, it turns out it was actually a pretty good choice!
